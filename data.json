        "insights": "As a child, I loved stamps. Not having yet discovered the power of google, I would tear them off of the envelopes I found them on, and use gum to stick them onto the pages of an old diary. Obviously, that’s a terrible way to collect stamps. Slowly, as my friends and relatives started bringing me the stamps they found, I learnt of their value, their cultural and historical significance. This project aims open the world of philately to new audiences and encourage a deeper appreciation for these miniature artefacts of human history. To calculate the indices for this project, I started by identifying key factors that influence a stamp’s value, such as condition, rarity, historical context, and printing techniques. Each factor was then quantified based on specific attributes—like the presence of words such as \"unused\" or \"mint\" in the description for condition, or terms like \"proof plate\" for rarity. These individual indices were then weighted and combined to create a composite score that reflects both tangible and cultural aspects of a stamp’s worth. The process aimed to balance objective analysis with the inherent subjectivity of valuing artifacts, making it easier to explore the Smithsonian’s stamp collection through an accessible, data-driven lens.",

It consolidates information about journalists who have been imprisoned, killed, or gone missing, alongside press freedom indexes and scores such as those from Reporters Without Borders and UNESCO. Using sources like the Committee to Protect Journalists, Wikipedia (for missing journalists), and global freedom indices, the dataset highlights how different political systems—democracies, dictatorships, and other forms of governance—affect freedom of the press. The hypothesis driving this dataset is that democracies typically provide more freedom of the press, while dictatorships and conflict zones exhibit restricted press freedom, often leading to human rights violations. It examines correlations between press freedom indices and incidents of harm to journalists, exploring how government policies, war, and economic conditions impact these outcomes. The dataset aims to provide a \"human-first\" approach by contextualizing journalists' experiences within their countries' political and social environments. This work lays the foundation for further research into press freedom's critical role in democracy and how its erosion signals broader negative human conditions. The dataset serves as a vital tool for researchers, journalists, and advocates working to protect press freedom and human rights globally.",
